The Kids Arenâ€™t Alright - The Offspring

[Verse 1]
When we were young the future was so bright (Woah)
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah)
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Woah)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

[Chorus]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

[Verse 2]
Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Woah)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (Woah)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot
Jay committed suicide (Woah)
Brandon OD'd and died (Woah)
What the hell is going on?
The cruelest dream, reality
[Chorus]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

[Outro]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
